# Climate-Risk-and Sustainability-Analysis

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Climate risk and Sustainability System is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and predict climate risks based on various features and indicators. This system leverages machine learning training and testing model and data visualization techniques to provide valuable insights into climate risk trends and factors influencing them. And Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) analysis of some particular countries for Sustainability purpose.

OVERVIEW

Features:<br />
Data Collection: Import climate risk data for 188 countries from various sources.<br /> 
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.<br /> 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore data patterns.<br /> 
Price Prediction: Predict climate risks for 3/188 countries using training-testing model.<br /> 
Feature Importance: Identify key factors influencing climate risk.<br /> 
User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for data input and results visualization.<br /> 

<p>What we have performed in this project is:<br /> 

We do basic descriptive analytics with pandas--<br /> 
Finding the shape of data means how many rows and columns of data.<br /> 
Mean, median, mode, Standard deviation.<br /> 
Percentile, of numeric columns of data and classes, and unique values of categorical columns.<br /> 
Finding the missing values, outlier detection, find the correlation between the variables.<br /> 
Perform linear regression and pre processing.</p>
